## [2026-04-07] — SQLite Partial Index Expression Matching (Equality Requirement)
**Status:** candidate-rule
**Area:** #sqlite #typescript
**Context:** App experienced 3-5 second rendering latency on the main dashboard (`LIMIT 1000` with an `ORDER BY`). The console logged slow queries filtering by `is_intermediate_gen != 1`.
**Finding:** The frontend SQL layer used `IFNULL(is_intermediate_gen, 0) != 1`. Even though it matched the index expression string, SQLite's B-Tree **cannot use a multi-column index to sort** if an intervening column is checked using an inequality operator (!=). It forced SQLite to dump the matching rows into a temporary B-Tree and perform a manual file sort.
**Solution:** Refactored the queries to use the equality counterpart: `IFNULL(is_intermediate_gen, 0) = 0`. Because it acts as an equality check, SQLite seamlessly spans the compound index `(is_deleted=?, expr1=?, expr2=?, timestamp DESC)` and eliminates the manual temp-tree sort entirely, dropping execution from ~5.3s to <1ms.
**Action:** → candidate-rule: Add to `docs/rules/data.md` to establish strict equality checks when sorting against bounds.

## [2026-03-19] — Test Environment Strategies
**Status:** candidate-rule
**Area:** #testing #react #rust
**Context:** Fixing 100+ failing UI and Rust unit tests across the Ambit project after major refactors.
**Finding:** 
1. React hooks relying on `react-query` or `zustand` fail with "No QueryClient set" or "Cannot destructure property" when tests do not provide the necessary Contexts.
2. Rust SQLite tests asserting cache behavior were panic-failing due to mismatching constraint strings (e.g. `'checkpoint'` vs `'checkpoints'`) causing constraint violations on tear-down.
**Solution:** 
1. Implement a unified `testUtils.tsx` wrapper that dynamically wraps all components and hooks under test in `QueryClientProvider`, `BrowserRouter`, `ToastProvider`, and `LibraryProvider`.
2. Strictly enforce literal typing for SQLite Enum replacements in Rust DB layers.
**Action:** → Consider graduating to `docs/testing.md`.

## [YYYY-MM-DD] — Short descriptive title
**Status:** one-off | candidate-rule | graduated | obsolete
**Area:** #tag1 #tag2
**Context:** What were you trying to do?
**Finding:** What was non-obvious, wrong, or worth knowing?
**Solution:** What fixed it or what is the correct pattern?
**Action:** → [candidate-rule: "Should move to X"] [graduated: "Moved to X on YYYY-MM-DD"]
